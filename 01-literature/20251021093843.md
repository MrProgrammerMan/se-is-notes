# Chapter 1.1.3 - Internet software engineering
With the introduction of the internet and the world-wide-web, software as a service became popularized. This dramatically simplifies deployment and updating of software, as it does not require managing a fleet of machines that all need the software installed. Innovations in web technologies such as HTML5, AJAX and more has made it **possible to create feature rich advanced software that can be accessed with a browser**. Wherever web-based software can be used, it is generally preferred due to it's **low cost**, particularly in user interface development. This has caused a shift in businees software to distributed models with high reuse of components.
For web-based software, this means:
1. Software reuse is the norm.
2. Web-based software is developed incrementally without full specification upfront.
3. Service-oriented software is a thing (like microprosess-architecture)
4. Rich and flexible interfaces are possible in a browser.
