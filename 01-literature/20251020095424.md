# Chapter 1.1: Professional Software Development
Professional software dominates the software space. Generally, it is developed by teams, intended to be used by someone other than the developer, and is maintained and changed thorugh its life.
The discipline of _software engineering_ is intended to support professional software development rather than individual software development.
Software in the professional sense includes the associated data, info and support related to the software program(s) themselves.

We distinguish between _generic_ and _bespoke_ software. The latter is commisioned by and prodiced for a specific customer. In development of generic software, the developing organization controls the software specification and can rethink it if needed. This is opposed to having to work by the specification of the customer. Increasinlgy, the line between generic and bespoke is blurred by large, customizable software adapted for several clients.
