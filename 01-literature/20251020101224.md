# Chapter 1.1.1: Software Engineering
Software engineering concerns all aspects of software production, from early planning and specification to maintainance and evolution. There are 2 main phases:
1. _Engineering discipline_ involves making things work, applyting theories and methods selectively to deliver within budget and time constraints.
2. Software engineering also involves _other aspects of software production_ such as devloping tools and methods and project management.

Generally a systematic and organized approach is helpful in software engineering. However, it depends on the project. The reason software engineering is so important is that:
1. Software is increasingly important in peoples lives and we require reliability and security.
2. Its cheaper to develop software in a thoughtful way from the get-go as opposed to the costs associated with maintaining and fixing bad software.

**The software process:**
1. Software specification
2. Software development
3. Software validation
4. Software evolution
