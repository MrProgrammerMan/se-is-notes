# Chapter 1.2 - Software Engineering Ethics
There are some aspects of the software engineering profession that are not concerned with the application of technical skills - but are nevertheless important.
Some examples:
1. Confidentiality, regardless of agreement.
2. Competence, or honesty if you will. Do not accept work outside your competence.
3. IP laws and regulations must be followed.
4. Computer misuse, you should not use your techincal skills to misues other peoples computers.

## The Code
ACM publishes the [Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics/software-engineering-code).

## Professional responsibility
It is the responsibility of the person claiming to be, or aspiring to be, a software engineer(who directly enables and /or causes good/bad effects on peoples lives, reliant on software systems) to uphold ethical principles in their work.

A software engineer may encounter situations where manager, employers, colleagues or non-technical partners fail to uphold proper ethical standards, in which case it may be appropriate to respond. This can mean taking up concerns with higher-ups, publishing concerns, informing customers, resigning. Typically infractions are minor and may simply be a misunderstanding or mis-specification in a system.
