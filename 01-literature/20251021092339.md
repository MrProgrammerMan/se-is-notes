# Chapter 1.1.2 - Software engineering diversity
We consider software to be in different categories based on different characteristics like platform it runs on, user interaction, purpose of the software, etc. Some examples of types of software:
- Stand-alone applications
- Interactive transaction-based applications
- Embedded control systems
- Batch processing systems
- Entertainment systems
- Modeling- and simulation systems
- Data collection and analysis systems
- Systems of systems
The boundries are blurred, and a lot of software fit in many categories.

Some fundamentals of software engineering apply to all systems:
1. Software should be developed using a clear and understood process, with well-defined roles, deadlines, results, etc.
2. Software should be dependable, and behave as expected, when it's expected to do so. It should be secure and not wasteful.
3. Software has to consider the specification and needs of the user. This means understanding users and managing user expectations.
4. Software should not be reinvented. Reuse is always better if applicable.
