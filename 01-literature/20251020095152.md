Software is everywhere. It is abstract and thus free. This makes it both flexible and often extremely complex. Many critizice software engineering for not delivering and causing failures. This is probably due to _high system complexity_ or _bad system development not adhering to proper software engineering techniques_.
In essence, **software engineering** is the field of precise and thoughful development of software, adhering to good practices and maintaining managability. This is not the same as software development. As software becomes more common, more vital, and more complex, the demand for good software engineering grows as the use of improper software development is high.
